## ✨ **Features**
- **Lightning-Fast Compression** 💜️  
  Shrink file sizes into a highly efficient binary format for optimal storage.
  
- **Seamless Decompression** 🔄  
  Effortlessly restore files to their original form with 100% accuracy.

- **Universal Compatibility** 🌐  
  Works with all file types up to 10 MB in size—be it text, images, or binaries.

- **Powered by Huffman Coding** 📉  
  Experience the elegance and efficiency of one of the best-known data compression algorithms.

## 🚀 **How It Works**
The project provides two robust command-line executables:  
- `compress`: For compacting files.  
- `uncompress`: For restoring compressed files.

## 🛠️ **Usage**

### 🔹 Compress a File
Transform your file into a smaller, compressed binary format:  
```bash
./compress <original-file> <compressed-file>
```
- **`<original-file>`**: The file you want to compress.  
- **`<compressed-file>`**: Where the compressed binary will be saved.  

Example:  
```bash
./compress report.txt report.huf
```

---

### 🔹 Decompress a File
Bring your compressed file back to life with zero data loss:  
```bash
./uncompress <compressed-file> <output-file>
```
- **`<compressed-file>`**: The compressed file to decompress.  
- **`<output-file>`**: Destination for the restored file.  

Example:  
```bash
./uncompress report.huf report_restored.txt
```
